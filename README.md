# DDR_dataset_lesion_segmentation_detection

Image detection and image segmentation files in DDR dataset.

The original DDR datasetï¼šhttps://github.com/nkicsl/DDR-dataset/blob/master/README.md#oia-ddr  

The original DDR dataset is a 14GB zip package, of which 13.2GB is a DR grading file. However, if you only need image segmentation and image detection files, you have to download additional DR grading files, so I upload the image segmentation and image detection files in the DDR dataset separately.  

If you make use of the DDR dataset, please cite the following paper:
